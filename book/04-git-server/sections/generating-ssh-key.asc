=== Ang paglikha ng iyong Pampublikong Susi ng SSH

(((SSH keys)))
Maraming mga server sa Git ang nagpapatunay gamit ang pampublikong susi ng SSH.
Upang makapagbigay ng pampublikong susi, bawat user sa iyong sistema ay dapat maglikha ng isa kung wala pa sila nakapaglikha.
Ang proseso na ito ay pareho sa iba't ibang mga operating system.
Una, dapat mong suriin upang siguraduhin na wala ka pang susi.
Bilang default, ang susi sa SSH ng gumagamit ay nakaimbak sa `~/.ssh` na direktorya ng gumagamit.
Madali mo lamang masuri upang makita kung mayroon ka ng susi sa pamamagitan ng pagpunta sa direktoryo at pag-lista sa mga nilalaman:

[source,console]
----
$ cd ~/.ssh
$ ls
authorized_keys2  id_dsa       known_hosts
config            id_dsa.pub
----

You're looking for a pair of files named something like `id_dsa` or `id_rsa` and a matching file with a `.pub` extension.
The `.pub` file is your public key, and the other file is your private key.
If you don't have these files (or you don't even have a `.ssh` directory), you can create them by running a program called `ssh-keygen`, which is provided with the SSH package on Linux/Mac systems and comes with Git for Windows:

[source,console]
----
$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/schacon/.ssh/id_rsa):
Created directory '/home/schacon/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/schacon/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/schacon/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
d0:82:24:8e:d7:f1:bb:9b:33:53:96:93:49:da:9b:e3 schacon@mylaptop.local
----

First it confirms where you want to save the key (`.ssh/id_rsa`), and then it asks twice for a passphrase, which you can leave empty if you don't want to type a password when you use the key.

Now, each user that does this has to send their public key to you or whoever is administrating the Git server (assuming you're using an SSH server setup that requires public keys).
All they have to do is copy the contents of the `.pub` file and email it.
The public keys look something like this:

[source,console]
----
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAklOUpkDHrfHY17SbrmTIpNLTGK9Tjom/BWDSU
